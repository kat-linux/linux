# Linux kernel
___

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the reStructuredText markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

# Kat Linux
[WIP] [WIP] [WIP]

## About it

### What is it?

**Kat linux is a Arch-based distro but about/for cats, it is based on [a discord server](https://discord.gg/DPKpHq5JPM) and cats in general.**

### Why?

**Me (lamp) really like cats and cats hub (discord server) and thats why i decided to make this distro, it had a name of "ropadi linux" before to jokely mock without hurting a retired admin of the discord server, but it was a bad name so we then eventually went with "Kat Linux"**

### Does it have a discord server?

**[Yes.](https://discord.gg/45tGzHRUjJ)**

## Is it easy to make this?

**[No.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lamps-dev/assets/refs/heads/main/ffe.png)**
